## DB Design
- Airplane Table
- Flight
- Airport
- City

- A flight belongs to an airplane but one airplane can be used in multiple fights
- A city has many airports but one airport belongs to a city
- One airport can have many flights, but a flight belongs to one airport

## Tables
### City -> id,name,created_at, updated_at
### Airport -> id,names,address,city_id,creatde_At,updated_at
    RelationShip -> City has many airports and Airports belongs to a city( one to many)
